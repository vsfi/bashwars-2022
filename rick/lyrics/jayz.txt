"Are you carrying a weapon on you, I know a lot of you are"
"Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something?"
"Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low"
"License and registration and step out of the car"
"Somebody important or something?"
"Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
"Well we'll see how smart you are when the K-9 come"
"Well you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four" (uh huh)
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
All because this fool was harassing them
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
And I know my rights so you goin' need a warrant for that
And there I go trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
But a pussy having no goddamn sense try and push me
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
D.A. tried to give a nigga shaft again
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
Fiends on the floor scratching again
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African
Having girl problems I feel bad for you son
He and his boys goin' be yapping to the Captain
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my papers legit
I don't know what you take me as
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
I got ninety-nine problems and a bitch ain't one
I got ninety-nine problems being a bitch ain't one, hit me
I got ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one
I got ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
I tried to ignore 'em, talk to the Lord
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I'm from the hood, stupid, what type of facts are those?
I'm like, "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
In my rearview mirror is the motherfucking law
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
Ninety-nine problems but a bitch ain't one
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Now once upon a time not too long ago
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
Paparazzi's with they cameras, snapping 'em
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
Pray for 'em, 'cause some fools just love to perform
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
So I, pull over to the side of the road
The only thing that's goin' happen is I'ma get to clapping and
The year's '94 and my trunk is raw
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharine
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
You're crazy for this one, Rick, it's your boy
