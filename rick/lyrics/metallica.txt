All I hear and see is laughter
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Come crawling faster
Dedicated to
Drift on numbered days
End of passion play, crumbling away
Feeding on your death's construction
Fix me
Hell is worth all that
How I'm killing you
I will help you die
I will occupy
I will run through you
I'm your source of self-destruction
Just a rhyme without a reason
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Laughing at my cries
Laughter, laughter
Life of death becoming clearer
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Master, master
More is all you need
Natural habitat
Needlework the way, never you betray
Neverending maze
Now I rule you too
Now your life is out of season
Obey your master
Obey your Master
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Sucking darkest clear
Taste me and you will see
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Veins that pump with fear
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Your life burns faster
