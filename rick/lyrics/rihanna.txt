(There's no distance in between our love)
And that's when you need me there
Baby, 'cause in the dark
Baby, come into me
Because
Come into me
Comin' down at the Dow Jones
Good girl gone bad
I'll be all you need and more
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
In G5s or better
It's okay, don't be alarmed
It's pouring rain
It's raining, raining
Know that we'll still have each other
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
No clouds in my stones
Now that it's raining more than ever
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
Said I'll always be your friend
So gon' and let the rain pour
Take three, action
These fancy things will never come in between
Told you I'll be here forever
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh, Hov
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
We fly higher than weather
We Rocafella
When the clouds come, we gone
When the sun shines, we shine together
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
When the world has dealt its cards
When the world has took its part
With you I'll always share
Yeah, Rihanna
You can always come into me
You can run into my arms
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
You can't see shiny cars
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
You know me
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
