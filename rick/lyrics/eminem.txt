"It's not hip-hop, it's pop, " 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, lookin' boy
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
And I should not be woken
And I'm a million leagues above you
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
Appeal with the skin color of mine
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
But if I can't batter the women
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
Feel my wrath of attack
For good at least once in a while
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Full of myself, but still hungry
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
How many verses I gotta murder to
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I got a laptop in my back pocket
I have, then you may be a little patient
I know there was a time where once I
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
I'm an MC still as honest
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
I'ma sleep in the front seat
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
It's me, my honesty's brutal
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Kneel before General Zod
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Let me know when it occurs to you
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
Little gay-lookin' boy
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
MCs get taken to school with this music
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
Now I lead a new school full of students
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
On the wall of shame
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Singin' to a man while he played piano
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
To censor you like that one line
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
Was king of the underground
We have nothin' in common, poodle
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
Why be a king when you can be a god?
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
With rock, shock rap with Doc
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
You are just what the doc ordered
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
You get too big and here they come tryin'
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
